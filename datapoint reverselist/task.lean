  Specification for `myReverse`:
  Reversing a list twice should yield the original list.

  Lemma: Reversal of concatenated lists.
  For any lists `xs` and `ys`, the reversal of their concatenation equals the reversal
  of `ys` appended with the reversal of `xs`.

  Theorem: Double reversal property.
  For any list `xs`, reversing it twice yields the original list.
