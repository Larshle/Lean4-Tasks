-----Description-----
This task implements a method to find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two given strings. The LCS of two strings is the longest sequence of characters that appear left-to-right (but not necessarily contiguously) in both strings. For example, the LCS of \"ABCBDAB\" and \"BDCABA\" is \"BCBA\" with length 4.

The solution must:
1. Return a valid subsequence of both input strings.
2. Have the maximum possible length among all subsequences common to both strings.

-----Input-----
str1: The first string.
str2: The second string.

-----Output-----
A string that is the LCS of str1 and str2.
