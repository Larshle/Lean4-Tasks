-----Description-----
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that sorts a list of integers using the merge sort algorithm. The method must return a new list that meets two constraints:
1. The elements are sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The output list is a permutation of the original list (i.e., it contains exactly the same elements as the input, with no additions or omissions).

Merge sort works by recursively splitting the list into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves back together.

-----Input-----
The input consists of a single list of integers, `arr`.

-----Output-----
The output is a new list of integers, which:
- Has the same length and elements as `arr`.
- Is sorted in non-decreasing order.
