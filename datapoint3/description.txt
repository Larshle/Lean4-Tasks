-----Description-----
This task requires writing a Lean 4 method that, given a list of integers, returns one of its Longest Increasing Subsequences (LIS). A subsequence of a list is formed by removing zero or more elements from the original list without changing the order of the remaining elements. This solution must satisfy:

1. The returned subsequence is strictly increasing: every element is strictly greater than the preceding one.
2. There is no strictly increasing subsequence in the input list that is longer than the returned subsequence.

-----Input-----
arr: A list of integers.

-----Output-----
A list of integers representing one of the longest strictly increasing subsequences in 'arr'.
